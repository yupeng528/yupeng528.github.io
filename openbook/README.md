# ditto
`ditto` inspired by [flatdoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/) is a markdown code
documentation system, capable of producing documentation similar to
[Three.js][2] and [Backbone.js][3], check out live demo [here][1]. It is
designed for people who use Github Pages to host their code documentation, but
you can also host it yourself.

You want to use ditto because
- Docs are in markdown
- No build process needed (markdown files are rendered on the browser)
- Deployable via GitHub Pages



## How do I start?
Enter the following command and follow instructions:


    curl -L https://git.io/v6T7r > install.sh && sh install.sh


Or alternatively see this page for [instructions][4].
